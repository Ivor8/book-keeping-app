we start by initializing npm in our book kepping app directory "npm init
" this simply means initialize your projects as  npm. this command will then walk you through a couple of steps in order to set up you app
a package.json file is then created, which manages all the packages we will use in our project

now, we are going to make use of express to create our server
we install express by running npm add express
we now set up our back end, starting with creating the server.js 

what is the port in the app.listen all about.  the port is what we are going to access in the url to be able to ask our server

now we have to create our folders and routes and APIs for the backend before we start with the front end
